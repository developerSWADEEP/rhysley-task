# Background Location Tracking Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Background Location Tracking Not Working When App is Closed/Screen Off
**Problem**: Location tracking only worked when the app was open and active.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Wake Lock**: Added `wakelock_plus` package to prevent device from sleeping during location tracking
- ✅ **Foreground Service**: Enabled `isForegroundMode: true` in Android configuration for proper background operation
- ✅ **Service Configuration**: Updated Android manifest with proper permissions and service configuration
- ✅ **Enhanced Location Settings**: Improved location tracking settings with better accuracy and timeout handling

### 2. Missing Notifications for Location Changes
**Problem**: No notifications were shown when location changed.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Local Notifications**: Added `flutter_local_notifications` package
- ✅ **Notification Service**: Created comprehensive notification service with proper channel management
- ✅ **Location Notifications**: Added notifications for every location change with detailed information
- ✅ **Service Status Notifications**: Added notifications for service start/stop events

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
```yaml
flutter_local_notifications: ^17.2.2
wakelock_plus: ^1.2.8
```

### 2. Android Manifest Updates
- Added wake lock permission: `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK`
- Added notification permissions: `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
- Added boot receiver for service restart
- Enhanced service configuration with `android:stopWithTask="false"`

### 3. Background Service Improvements
- **Wake Lock Management**: Prevents device from sleeping during location tracking
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error recovery with exponential backoff
- **Foreground Mode**: Proper foreground service configuration for Android
- **Health Checks**: Periodic health monitoring to ensure service continues running

### 4. Notification System
- **Location Notifications**: Shows detailed location info for every update
- **Service Status**: Notifications for service start/stop events
- **Proper Channels**: Separate notification channels for different types
- **Rich Content**: Big text style notifications with location details

### 5. Permission Management
- **Notification Permission**: Added notification permission request
- **Enhanced Location Permissions**: Better handling of location permissions
- **Permission Status Checking**: Comprehensive permission validation

## Technical Details

### Wake Lock Implementation
```dart
// Enable wake lock to prevent device from sleeping
await WakelockPlus.enable();
```

### Enhanced Location Settings
```dart
Geolocator.getPositionStream(
  locationSettings: const LocationSettings(
    accuracy: LocationAccuracy.bestForNavigation,
    distanceFilter: 1, // Update every 1 meter
    timeLimit: Duration(minutes: 10), // Longer timeout
  ),
)
```

### Notification Implementation
```dart
await NotificationService.showLocationNotification(
  latitude: position.latitude,
  longitude: position.longitude,
  accuracy: position.accuracy,
  speed: position.speed,
);
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install the app** and grant all permissions (location, notification)
2. **Login** to the app
3. **Start location tracking** from the home screen
4. **Test scenarios**:
   - Keep app open: Should see location updates and notifications
   - Minimize app: Should continue tracking and showing notifications
   - Lock screen: Should continue tracking in background
   - Close app completely: Should continue tracking (Android)

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Location tracking works when app is closed
- ✅ Location tracking works when screen is locked
- ✅ Notifications appear for every location change
- ✅ Service status notifications show start/stop events
- ✅ Wake lock prevents device from sleeping during tracking
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and recovery
- ✅ Proper foreground service operation on Android

## Notes

- **Android**: Full background support with foreground service
- **iOS**: Limited background support due to iOS restrictions
- **Battery**: Wake lock may increase battery usage - monitor device battery
- **Permissions**: Users must grant location and notification permissions
- **Testing**: Test on physical device for accurate background behavior

## Troubleshooting

If location tracking still doesn't work in background:

1. Check device battery optimization settings
2. Ensure location services are enabled
3. Verify all permissions are granted
4. Check Android Doze mode settings
5. Test on different Android versions
6. Monitor device logs for service errors
